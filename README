# scala-zeromq

Requires libzmq (v2.1.0 or greater) and libjzmq.

An Akka zeromq library loosely based on Akka's own zeromq included zeromq 
support but with an architeture better reflecting zeromq's intended usage.

scala-zeromq uses one zeromq context per ActorSystem, with a single actor using
a PinnedDispatcher polling all active sockets. Sockets are polled selectively to
make efficient use of CPU time.
