# scala-zeromq

**Requires libzmq (v2.1.0 or greater) and either 
[JZMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq) or 
[zeromq-scala-binding](https://github.com/valotrading/zeromq-scala-binding)**

scala-zeromq facilitates communication use the [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) 
messaging library. ZeroMQ is a message-orient socket communication library that
support several high-level messaging patterns, including request-reply, publish-
subscribe and push-pull. For a thorough description of how ZeroMQ works, read 
the [guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org). 

Unlike many ZeroMQ libraries, scala-zeromq provides a *completely threadsafe*
ZeroMQ socket inteface. All socket communications are conducted using an
immutable handle called a SocketRef. Under the hood, scala-zeromq uses
[Akka](http://akka.io) to ensure all socket interactions are handled safely and
efficiently.

## Using

In your build.sbt

    resolvers += "mDialog snapshots" at "http://mdialog.github.io/snapshots/"

    libraryDependencies += "com.mdialog" %% "scala-zeromq" % "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"

To get started, create some sockets

    val pushSocket = ZeroMQ.socket(SocketType.Push)
    val pullSocket = ZeroMQ.socket(SocketType.Pull)

Then, bind one to a socket address and connect the other. ZeroMQ supports 
several message transport protocols in socket addresses.

    pushSocket.bind("tcp://localhost:5560")
    pullSocket.connect("tcp://localhost:5560")

Then, send and receive messages. scala-zeromq messages are an IndexedSeq of Akka
[ByteString](http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/snapshot/#akka.util.ByteString) 
objects.

    pushSocket.send(Message(ByteString("one"), ByteString("two")))

    val message = pullSocket.recv // blocks indefinitely awaiting message
    // message: zeromq.Message = Message(ByteString("one"), ByteString("two")))


If you'd like to stop receive requests on a socket, close it.

    pushSocket.close

## Using with Akka

scala-zeromq is actually implemented as an Akka Extension. To use it with Akka,
load the extension either manually or automatically (through application 
configuration). 

Use the extension to request a new socket. Assign an ActorRef as the listener 
if you expect the socket to receive messages.

    val zmq = ZeroMQExtension(system)

    val pushSocket = zmq.newSocket(SocketType.Push, Bind("tcp://localhost:5560"))
    val pullSocket = zmq.newSocket(SocketType.Pull, Connect("tcp://localhost:5560"), Listener(anActorRef))

To send messages over the socket, send them to the socket actor

    pushSocket ! Message(ByteString("one"), ByteString("two"))

Messages are received as zeromq.Message objects sent to the actor assigned as
each socket's listener.
